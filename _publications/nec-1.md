Radioactive particle tracking (RPT) is a non-invasive technique used to monitor opaque multiphase flow systems. Achieving highly accurate particle tracing is challenging and time-consuming because of the need to build a new RPT model from calibration data each time the experimental conditions change. This paper aims to examine if RPT calibration data under previous conditions can be leveraged with the help of transfer learning (TL) when creating an RPT model for a new condition.  
The results show that when it is impractical to collect a lot of calibration data, TL is often superior to training an RPT model only on new data. Moreover, when new calibration data collection is not feasible, an RPT model trained on historical data can be very accurate if sufficiently similar to the historical conditions.

Under the scenario of distinct data distribution between source and target data, we investigated the applicability of meta-learning techniques (MAML, Reptile, Meta-SGD), it is shown the results are comparable with simply fine-tuning a pretrained FNN model.

This paper focuses on ranking computer science departments based on the quality of publications by the faculty in those departments. There are multiple strategies to convert publication lists into ranking scores for the departments. Important open questions include handling multi-author publications, inclusion criteria for publications and publication venues, accounting for the quality of publication venues, and accounting for the sub-areas of computer science. An ablation study is performed to evaluate the importance of different decisions for department ranking. The correlation between the resulting rankings and the peer assessment of computer science departments provided by the U.S. News was measured to evaluate the importance of different decisions. The results show that the selection of publication venues has the highest impact on the ranking. In contrast, decisions related to publication recency, multi-author publications, and clustering publications into subareas have less impact. Overall, Pearson's correlation coefficient between the publication-based scores and the U.S. News ranking is above 0.90 for a large range of decisions, indicating a strong agreement between the objective measure and the subjective opinion of peers.

Traditional rain detection methods are often constrained by their limited spatial coverage and lack of adaptability in diverse environmental conditions. This gap highlights the need for more advanced, adaptable solutions for rain detection. Recent advances in distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) have shown potential for overcoming these limitations. Using DAS, we propose a CNN with unsupervised domain adaptation technique that utilizes already-laid optical fiber networks for rain intensity classification. Specifically, firstly we collected the field data from a live telecommunication network using DAS underdifferent field environment, which was recorded over eight different days spanning five months. After filtering and feature extraction, a Deep Reconstruction Classification Network (DRCN) is implemented to concurrently minimize both the classification loss and reconstruction lossduring the learning process, aiming to capture a domain adaptive feature representa- tion applicable to new environmental conditions. Experimental results show that our approach effectively identifies rain status and adapts well to rain intensity classification across newdomains, addressing the gap left by machine learning methods in the context of unlabeled field data. This adaptability is crucial fordeveloping more accurate and reliable rain detection systems that capable of functioning effectively across various domains.
