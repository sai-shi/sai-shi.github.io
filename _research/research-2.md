Faculty citation measures are highly correlated with peer assessment of computer science doctoral programs ([Our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05435.pdf)). We built and maintained a new CS ranking website based on the updated facultu citation data and incorporate citation information in our ranking metrics ([Our ranking website](https://chi.temple.edu/csranking_2021/)).
Currently, we are investigating the subjectivity factors in popular ranking websites (CSRanking, CSmetrics, etc.). The objective of this ablation study is to investigate the effect of the multitude of decisions taken during the metric based academic department ranking on the final ranking outcome. We focus on venue clustering, venue selection, different weighting schemes and data time-span. The ranking performance is evaluated based on its correlation with the U.S. News ranking, a widely used and popular doctoral program ranking prepared based on peer assessments.
