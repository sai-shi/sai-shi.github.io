Hi! I am Sai, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Temple University](https://cis.temple.edu/academics/graduate/phd/), under supervision from Prof. [Slobodan Vucetic](https://dabi.temple.edu/slobodan-vucetic/). I am excited about solving open data science problems using machine learning and statistical methodologies.

Research Interests
======
I am interested in solving real-life data science problems in various fields: Communication Networks, Physical Science, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. My research focus is answering the question: how to apply/optimize machine learning algorithms to practical scenarios for better decision making and problem solving given limited resources (available data, domain knowledge, computing hardware, etc.).

Current research projects include: transfer learning, meta-learning, domain adaptation, model compression, ranking analysis.
