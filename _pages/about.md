Hi! I am Sai, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Temple University](https://cis.temple.edu/academics/graduate/phd/), under supervision from Prof. [Slobodan Vucetic](https://dabi.temple.edu/slobodan-vucetic/). 

<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZNl5CXZpZm4TqR42hwRBPDEC_wBdT_jc/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">My CV</a>

Research Interests
======
My current research focused on applied machine learning, which is to use existing algorithms and models to address specific tasks across various industries, including wireless, physics, rankings, etc. I am particularly interested in transfer learning, domain adaptation, efficient AI, and lifelong learning algorithms. My research focus is answering the question: how to apply/optimize machine learning algorithms to practical scenarios for better decision making and problem solving given limited resources (available data, domain knowledge, computing hardware, etc.).
