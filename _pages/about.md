Hi! I am Sai, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Temple University](https://cis.temple.edu/academics/graduate/phd/), under supervision of Prof. [Slobodan Vucetic](https://dabi.temple.edu/slobodan-vucetic/). I am excited about solving open data science problems using machine learning and statistical methodologies. 

<a href="https://github.com/sai-shi/sai-shi.github.io/blob/master/files/sai_shi_CV.pdf" target="_blank">My CV</a>

Research Interests
======
In general, I am interested in solving real-life data science problems in various fields: Communication Networks, Chemicals, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. My research focus is answering the question: how to apply/optimize machine learning algorithms to practical scenarios for better decision making and problem solving given limited resources (available data, domain knowledge, computing hardware, etc.).

Current research projects include: transfer learning, few-shot/zero-shot learning, distribution alignment, generative models, university ranking.

Education
======
* M.S. in Electrical Engineering, University of California - Irvine, 2013-2015 (GPA: 3.6/4.0)
* M.S. in Computer Engineering, Arizona State University, 2016-2018 (GPA: 3.7/4.0)
* Ph.D in Computer Science, Temple University, 2019-2024 (GPA: 3.7/4.0)

After graduation from UC-Irvine, I felt interested in Artificial Intelligence and started to learn Python myself. I got my second MS degree from Arizona State University, major in Computer engineering, where I immersed myself deeper in this field and was futher impressed by how Data Science and Machine Learning is changing the world, and decided to change my career path from hardware to software. I continued my research as a Ph.D. student at Temple University in 2019.
