Computer Vision
======
Course Project: Reinforcement Learning in self-playing video games ([project_link](https://github.com/sai-shi/Reinforcement-Learning-in-self-playing-video-game))
* Reproduced OpenAIâ€™s PPO algorithm and successfully trained AI to self-play MS-Pacman 
* Optimized training performance by CNN feature extraction, motion tracking, and epsilon-greedy algorithm

Natural Language Processing
======
Course Project: Sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews ([project_link](https://github.com/sai-shi/Sentiment-Analysis-of-restaurant-reviews))
* Implemented natural language processing model to predict polarity of restaurant reviews
* Improved accuracy by 2% using attention mechanisms, bi-LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) and ABSA (Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis)

Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
======
Course Project: Question Answering algorithm comparison ([project_link](https://github.com/sai-shi/Reinforcement-Learning-in-self-playing-video-game))
* Implemented a question answering system using BERT and achieved 0.80 F-1 score for SQuAD2.0
* Evaluated the effectiveness and limitations of unsupervised learning, supervised learning and BERT on QA task

Principles of Data Management
======
Course Project: JSON document database design and analysis ([project_link](https://github.com/sai-shi/JSON-document-database-design-and-analysis))
* Designed and optimized relational database of json documents using MongoDB and MySQL 
* Conducted comparison study between RDBMS and NoSQL

Cloud Computing
======
Course Project: Cloud drive application development using AWS ([project_link](https://github.com/sai-shi/Cloud-Drive-Application))
