Computer Vision
======
Course Project: Reinforcement Learning in self-playing video games([project_link](https://github.com/sai-shi/Reinforcement-Learning-in-self-playing-video-game))
* Reproduced OpenAIâ€™s PPO algorithm and successfully trained AI to self-play MS-Pacman 
* Optimized training performance by CNN feature extraction, motion tracking, and epsilon-greedy algorithm

Natural Language Processing
======
Course Project: Sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews([project_link](https://github.com/sai-shi/Sentiment-Analysis-of-restaurant-reviews))
* Implemented natural language processing model to predict polarity of restaurant reviews
* Improved accuracy by 2% using attention mechanisms, bi-LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) and ABSA (Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis)
